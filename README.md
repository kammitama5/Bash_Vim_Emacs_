# Bash_Vim_Emacs_

Shortcuts and files created while learning Bash/Vim/Emacs.
I've done a little vi and Emacs before, but haven't decided on any of these editors
(not that I have to make a choice anytime soon). 
I guess over time it will become clear which one is more suitable. 

===========================================
Bash 

- ```chmod +x filename``` if ```./ filename``` gives output ```permission denied```

===========================================
Vim


===========================================
Emacs
